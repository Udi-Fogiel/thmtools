The `thmtools` bundle provides several packages for commonly-needed 
features for theorems. As designed, the bundle should work with kernel
theorems (theorems ‘out of the box’ with \LaTeX), the `theorem` 
package and the `amsthm` package.
    
Provided features:
 - a keyval interface to `\newtheorem` and `\newtheoremstyle`
 - a `\listoftheorem` command with filtering ability
 - `hyperref` and `cleveref` compatibility
 - a way of restating entire theorems with a single macro call
